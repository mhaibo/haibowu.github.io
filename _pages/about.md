Hi! My name is Haibo Wu and I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Statistics at University of British Columbia, Canada. Previously, I recevied my M.Sc. in May 2023 at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia, where I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. [Hernando Ombao](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/hernando-ombao). Before that, I got my bachelor degree in Electronics Engineering in June 2021 at Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

During my leisure time, I enjoy cooking, drinking and working out.
